                <p>
                    Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan Rus, which during the 10th and 11th
                    centuries was the largest and most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and
                    Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into
                    the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid the
                    foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the
                    Cossack Hetmanate, was established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles.
                    Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well over 100
                    years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was
                    absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine achieved a
                    short-lived period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and endured a brutal Soviet rule
                    that engineered two forced famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War
                    II, German and Soviet armies were responsible for 7 to 8 million more deaths. Although Ukraine
                    achieved independence in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and prosperity remained
                    elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic reform,
                    privatization, and civil liberties.</p>
                <p>A peaceful mass protest referred to as the "Orange Revolution" in the closing months of 2004 forced
                    the authorities to overturn a rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally
                    monitored vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal
                    squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in
                    parliamentary (Rada) elections, become prime minister in August 2006, and be elected president in
                    February 2010. In October 2012, Ukraine held Rada elections, widely criticized by Western observers
                    as flawed due to use of government resources to favor ruling party candidates, interference with
                    media access, and harassment of opposition candidates. President YANUKOVYCH's backtracking on a
                    trade and cooperation agreement with the EU in November 2013 - in favor of closer economic ties with
                    Russia - and subsequent use of force against students, civil society activists, and other civilians
                    in favor of the agreement led to a three-month protest occupation of Kyiv's central square. The
                    government's use of violence to break up the protest camp in February 2014 led to all out pitched
                    battles, scores of deaths, international condemnation, and the president's abrupt departure for
                    Russia. New elections in the spring allowed pro-West president Petro POROSHENKO to assume office on
                    7 June 2014.</p>
                <p>Shortly after YANUKOVYCH's departure in late February 2014, Russian President PUTIN ordered the
                    invasion of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula claiming the action was to protect ethnic Russians living
                    there. Two weeks later, a "referendum" was held regarding the integration of Crimea into the Russian
                    Federation. The "referendum" was condemned as illegitimate by the Ukrainian Government, the EU, the
                    US, and the UN General Assembly (UNGA). In response to Russia's purported annexation of Crimea, 100
                    members of the UN passed UNGA resolution 68/262, rejecting the "referendum" as baseless and invalid
                    and confiming the sovereignty, political independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
                    Russia also continues to supply separatists in two of Ukraine's eastern provinces with manpower,
                    funding, and materiel resulting in an armed conflict with the Ukrainian Government. Representatives
                    from Ukraine, Russia, and the unrecognized separatist republics signed the Minsk Protocol and
                    Memorandum in September 2014 to end the conflict. However, this agreement failed to stop the
                    fighting. In a renewed attempt to alleviate ongoing clashes, leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and
                    Germany negotiated a follow-on package of measures in February 2015 to implement the Minsk
                    Agreements. Representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
                    in Europe also meet regularly to facilitate implementation of the peace deal. More than 33,000
                    civilians have been killed or wounded in the fighting resulting from Russian aggression in eastern
                    Ukraine.

                    Because Ukraine has large amount of ore reserves, the mine process has resulted in pollution in many
                    environmental aspects</p>
                <p>Ukraine releases polluted water, heavy metal, organic compounds, and oil-related pollutants into the
                    Black Sea. The water supply in some areas of the country contains toxic industrial chemicals up to
                    10 times the concentration considered to be within safety limits.</p>
                <p>Air pollution is a significant environmental problem in the Ukraine. In 1992, Ukraine had the
                    world's seventh-highest level of industrial carbon dioxide emissions, which totaled 611.3 million
                    metric tons, a per capita level of 11.72. In 1996, the total had dropped significantly to 397
                    million metric tons. The pollution of the nation's water has resulted in large-scale elimination of
                    the fish population, particularly in the Sea of Azov.

                <p>
                    The central bank of Ukraine hiked its key discount rate by 100bps to 14.5% on December 14th 2017,
                    surprising markets who expected no changes. It follows a similar move in the previous meeting, amid
                    higher than expected inflation. Inflation expectations deteriorated due raw food prices, wages and a
                    risk of a more significant increase in social standards that can affect cost of goods and services
                    and demand. In November, the inflation declined to 13.6 percent from 14.6 percent in October.
                    However the decrease was slower than forecasts, mainly due to higher production costs and a recovery
                    in demand. Interest Rate in Ukraine averaged 40 percent from 1992 until 2017, reaching an all time
                    high of 300 percent in October of 1994 and a record low of 6.50 percent in August of 2013.

                    Ukraine consumer prices increased 13.6 percent year-on-year in November of 2017, easing from a 14.6
                    percent rise in the preceding month. It was the lowest inflation rate since May. Prices eased for

                    tobacco (23.8 percent vs 24.7 percent); housing and utilities (10.3 percent vs 15.2 percent) and
                    recreation and culture (3.9 percent vs 4.5 percent). In contrast, cost rose further for transport
                    (15.4 percent vs 14.4 percent); health (6.9 percent vs 6.4 percent); communication (11.5 percent vs

                    From the table of import and export composition, it could be observed that Ukraine is benefiting

                <h4 id="2.4.4">2.4.4 Protectionism Policies</h4>
                <p>
                    There is very limited information on the internet regarding the protectionism policies implemented
                    by Ukraine government. Systematic descriptions are rare.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The Ukrainian government
                        has been actively analyzing and addressing unnecessary trade barriers that encumber trade,
                        working
                        to make the business environment more simple and transparent for local and foreign companies.
                        While
                        the environment is improving, many trade barriers in Ukraine persist, including unpredictable
                        discriminatory fees and product certification procedures. Non-tariff barriers include
                        non-transparent standards and certification requirements, cumbersome procedures for
                        phytosanitary
                        certifications, import licenses, and labeling requirements.</p>

                    <p>Over the past few years the Government of Ukraine occasionally temporarily restricted imports of
                        U.S. agricultural products, allegedly because of food safety concerns. In addition, in November
                        2010, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine signed Order #971, approving a list of food products
                        that
                        require monitoring for genetically engineered or genetically modified organism (GMO) content.
                        Among
                        the groups of products to be tested and monitored are soybeans and soybean products, corn and
                        products made with corn, potatoes and potato-derived products, tomatoes, and tomato products,
                        rice
                        and rice products, wheat and products made of wheat, baby food made with such products, food
                        additives."</p>

                <h2 id="3.1">3.1 Type of Aid</h2>
                <h5>Humanitarian Aid</h5><br/>
                <h4 id="3.1.1">3.1.1 Justification</h4>
                <p>The armed conflict in eastern Ukraine is now in its fourth year. The conflict has led to staggering
                    humanitarian needs, claimed over 10,000 lives (nearly 3,000 civilian) and damaged critical civilian
                    infrastructure. Thousands of civilians living close to the contact line are still suffering under
                    shelling. Many citizens face significant challenges as a result of the suspension of social and
                    financial services in the divided parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Restrictions on movement of
                    people and goods across the contact line make life extremely difficult for people living in the
                    eastern
                    regions.</p>
                <p>An estimated four million people are in need of humanitarian support, and while humanitarian groups
                    are
                    doing their best to meet needs, there is a serious lack of funding and international attention to
                    the
                    ongoing humanitarian crisis. Protracted displacement is a challenge and lack of livelihood
                    opportunities
                    forces some Internally Displaced People (IDPs) to return to insecure areas. The main challenges for
                    aid
                    organizations are providing assistance to 1,583,827 registered IDPs in Ukraine (by April 25th, 2017)
                    and
                    accessing to those in need living on the other side of contact line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The situation in the Donbass (Eastern) region exposes and aggravates systemic and structural flaws
                    that,
                    in turn, negatively impact the humanitarian situation. This drawn out crisis has weakened people’s
                    ability to cope. Therefore, the role of the international humanitarian actors is critical.

                <h4 id="3.1.2">3.1.2 Amout and Timeline</h4>
                <p>Humanitarian aid is needed until the violence conflict and crises in the country stops.</p>
                <h4 id="3.1.3">3.1.3 Goals</h4>
                <p>Goals of this aid include: access multisectoral humanitarian assistance, access to job and markets,
                    cash to restore livelihoods, water for frontline villages, shelter for affected families, and access
                    to health and psychosocial services.</p>
                <h2 id="3.2">3.2 Past Aids</h2>
                <p>BEIJING — China's Foreign Ministry said that international financial bodies ought to be
                    offering aid to Ukraine to ensure its economic stability, though it stopped short of saying whether
                    Beijing would participate in such efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    U.S. President Barack Obama has also urged the IMF to reach agreement swiftly on a financial support
                    package for Kyiv, which would unlock additional aid from the European Union and Washington.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Asked about aid for Ukraine, China, whose President Xi Jinping discussed Ukraine with Obama on
                    Monday, said that the government "upholds the maintaining of Ukraine's financial stability."
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The United States, working with partners around the world, stands ready to provide support for
                    Ukraine as it takes the reforms it needs to, to get back to economic stability,” said White House
                    spokesman Jay Carney, adding that “this support can complement an IMF program by helping to make
                    reforms easier”.

                <h4>Potential for Corruption</h4>
                <p>Since 1992, the U.S. has sent $3 billion to $5 billion in aid to Ukraine, with only cursory public
                    disclosure. The U.S. State Department operates an online database, ForeignAssistance.gov, but names
                    of foreign recipients are often left out, and entire sections are blank. Furthermore, the disclosure
                    often comes long after the money has been distributed.

                    “It is incredibly hard to find this kind of information,” Nicole Valentinuzzi, communications
                    manager for Publish What You Fund, an international organization promoting transparency for foreign
                    aid.</p>
                <p>...<br/>
                    USAID has advocated and funded Ukraine transparency programs and laws, including the nation’s 2011
                    freedom of information law and the creation of the Ukrainian Electronic Disclosure System, a public
                    database of financial reports modeled on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR system.
