# Economics Case Study

This repository contains country profile, macroeconomic indicators for the Netherlands and Ukraine, and also the development proposal for the Ukraine as a developing country.

Decided not to present my economic case study in class using traditional mulitmedia, I designed this web page which
facilitates convenient and interactive access to data and figures.
